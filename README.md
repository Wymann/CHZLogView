# CHZLogView
Print and view logs on your APP easily. 一行代码输出日志到App上。

CHZLogView can be installed using [CocoaPods](https://cocoapods.org/).

If you haven't done so already, you might want to initialize the project, to have it produce a `Podfile` template for you:

```
$ pod init
```

Then, edit the `Podfile`, adding `FMDB`:

```ruby
# Uncomment the next line to define a global platform for your project
# platform :ios, '9.0'

target 'MyApp' do
    pod 'CHZLogView'
end
```

Then install the pods:

```
$ pod install
```

Then open the `.xcworkspace` rather than the `.xcodeproj`.
